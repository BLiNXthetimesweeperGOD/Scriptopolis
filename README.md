Requirements:
- PyGame
- Python 3 or newer

The source code for this game is VERY messy. Feel free to modify it in any way you'd like and make your own versions of the game (as long as you at least link the original page for it somewhere anyways).

The original versions were based on a tutorial I found back in 2019. The tutorial lacked scrolling and had a bug where jumping while moving would teleport you to the left side of the platform you're standing on. I eventually kind of fixed the bug, but it required a nearly complete rewrite of the physics code.

THIS IS AN ARCHIVE OF THE OLDER VERSIONS! Expect a messy filesystem. Expect broken code. Expect missing assets. That said, anyone is allowed to modify the game. Have fun if you want to do that!
