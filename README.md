# Scriptopolis
An absolute mess of source code. This was the first actual game-like thing I ever did with Python, so it's all over the place and really disorganized.
Scriptopolis is a 2D platformer that was built off of the only tutorial I could find for this kind of thing back in 2019. If I remember correctly, the tutorial didn't include much when it came to scrolling (may be misremembering though), so I decided to sort of hack in scrolling myself. That's why the game is a bit of a buggy mess and why literally every single version of it is basically just a bunch of test levels, as I didn't want it to be an unplayable mess.
